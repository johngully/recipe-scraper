Has anyone tried freezing this? Feels like an amazing thing to cook up a bunch and freeze in individual containers to warm up for a quick meal.

I'm so happy to have the recipe! I made it last night and it tastes just like the soup at La Madeleine's! It was easy to make and everyone loved it. I used canned, crushed tomatoes and 1 can of chicken broth with enough tomato juice to equal 4 cups of liquid. A new family favorite!

The only change I made was using light evaporated milk instead of cream. This soup with deliciously simple to make and tasting.

This is quick and easy to make and the flavour is wonderful. I used canned tomatoes and fresh basil. I would lighten it up next time by using a lighter cream or milk. Actually, we kept "testing" it as it simmered and both of us agreed that it would make quite a nice soup without the milk at all. I will make this again soon, and often.

I made this soup yesterday. After reading other reviews I added a tsp of minced garlic and onion powder and salt in when I simmered the tomatoes. I used canned whole tomatoes and fresh basil and I used 3 cups tomato juice to 1 cup veg. stock. I did opt for the lemon juice based on other reviews also. It came out really good. Not exactly like La Madeline's but pretty darn close. I think it was a little thinner than LaMadelines version. I think next time I would use another cup or two of tomatoes and I think it would thicken it up a bit. Overall very good and would certainly make again.

I've made this for years since la Madeline recipe was posted in the houston chronicle newspaper 20 yrs ago...I use half n half and it's so rich. I make it nog dairy for my mom using coconut milk and almond milk and it's very creamy this way too...no lemon juice tho. The crushed tomatoes are acidic enough and the fresh basil gives it a lot of brightness. This recipe is the closest to the real restaurants.

I like to roast the tomatoes for 45 minutes in the oven set to 100 degrees(Fahrenheit) and then start the recipe. It gives them a sweet flavor .

I will reduce the amount of chicken stock in the future unless I have time to cook it down a bit. I like my soup a bit thicker. Also added a bit of ground white pepper along with the fresh ground black.

I use two cans of tomato soup and two cups of water. I think it adds to the flavor.

LOVED this soup. Although I added about 3 Tbls of sugar as the tomatoes were too acidic. Turned out perfect!

Used canned crushed tomatoes (2 large full cans that was a little more than 4 cups) and 3 cups of chicken stock - no tomato juice (but it was because I forgot to get it).
